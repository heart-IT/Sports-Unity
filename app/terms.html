			<h4>User Status Submissions</h4>
			<p class=""><span class="bullet-point">A.</span>The Sports Unity Service allows Sports Unity  Site users to submit status text, profile photos and other communications submitted by you, as well as the automatic submission of your “last seen” status (collectively, the "Status Submissions"). These Status Submissions may be hosted, shared, and/or published as part of the Sports Unity Service, and may be visible to other users of the Service which you have not expressly blocked. For clarity, direct messages, location data and photos or files that you send directly/share to other Sports Unity Site users will only be viewable by those Sports Unity Site  user(s) or group(s); but Status Submissions may be globally viewed by Sports Unity Site  users, unless the user is blocked by you. Currently, we have no method of providing different levels of visibility of your Status Submissions among users that have your mobile phone number – you acknowledge and agree that any Status Submissions may be globally viewed by users, so don’t submit or post status messages or profile photos that you don’t want to be seen globally. A good rule of thumb is if you don’t want the whole world to know something or see something, don’t submit it as a Status Submission to the Service. The submission of your 'last seen' status is done on an automatic basis. As clarified in the following section, you retain your ownership rights in your Status Submissions. You understand that whether or not such Status Submissions are published, Sports Unity does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any submissions.</p>
			<p class=""><span class="bullet-point">B.</span>You shall be solely responsible for your own Status Submissions and the consequences of posting or publishing them. Because Sports Unity is only acting as a repository of data, user submitted statuses do not necessarily represent the views or opinions of Sports Unity and Sports Unity makes no guarantees as to the validity, accuracy or legal status of any status. In connection with Status Submissions, you affirm, represent, and/or warrant that: (i) you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and authorize Sports Unity to use all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to any and all Status Submissions to enable inclusion and use of the Status Submissions in the manner contemplated by the Service and these Terms of Service; and (ii) you have the written consent, release, and/or permission of each and every identifiable individual person in the Status Submission to use the name or likeness of each and every such identifiable individual person to enable inclusion and use of the Status Submissions in the manner contemplated by the Service and these Terms of Service. To be clear: you retain all of your ownership rights in your Status Submissions, but you have to have the rights in the first place. However, by submitting the Status Submissions to Sports Unity Site, you hereby grant Sports Unity a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the Status Submissions in connection with the Sports Unity Service and Sports Unity's (and its successor's) business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Sports Unity Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant each subscriber to your status on the Sports Unity Service a non-exclusive license to access your Status Submissions through the Service. The foregoing license granted by you terminates once you remove or delete a Status Submission from the Sports Unity Service.</p>
			<p class=""><span class="bullet-point">C.</span>To file a copyright infringement notification, please send a written communication that includes substantially the following Copyright Act): (i) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (ii) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works; (iii) Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material, including the mobile phone number of the Sports Unity user allegedly infringing the copyrighted work; (iv) Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted; (v) A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
